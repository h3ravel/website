# Availability

By default, Musket CLI is installed with full setup on every H3ravel application allowing to jump into prodctivity without having to bother about setup. To see a list of all available commands, you can run:

::: code-group

```sh [npx]
$ npx musket list
```

```sh [npm]
$ npm musket list
```

```sh [yarn]
$ yarn musket list
```

```sh [pnpm]
$ pnpm musket list
```

```sh [bun]
$ bun musket list
```

:::

Each command also includes a detailed **help screen** describing its available arguments and options. You can access it by prefixing the command name with `help`:

::: code-group

```sh [npx]
$ npx musket help migrate
```

```sh [npm]
$ npm musket help migrate
```

```sh [yarn]
$ yarn musket help migrate
```
