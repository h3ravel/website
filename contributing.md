## Basics

- Use `lowercase` for branch names and commit messages for consistency.
- Write concise, clear commit messages; split complex changes into smaller commits if needed.
- Keep commit titles under 72 characters, adding details in the extended description if necessary.
- Address one concern per commit, grouping related changes together and separating unrelated ones.

## Branch Naming

Adopt this branch naming convention for clarity and instant recognition of purpose:

### Format:

`<prefix>/<short-description>`

### Main Prefixes:

- `feat/`: New feature development.
- `fix/`: Bug fixes and corrections.
- `remove/`: Removing files or features.
- `docs/`: Documentation changes.
- `style/`: Visual or formatting updates (no logic changes).
- `refactor/`: Code restructuring without functional changes.
- `perf/`: Performance enhancements.
- `test/`: Test additions or updates.
- `build/`: Build system or dependency modifications.
- `ci/`: Continuous integration updates.
- `chore/`: Routine maintenance tasks.

### Example Branch Names:

- `feat/auth-middleware`
- `fix/translation-error`
- `docs/api-endpoints`
- `style/user-contract-interface`

## Crafting Clear Commits

Write concise, meaningful commit messages to clarify changes for collaborators.

### Commit Format:

`<type>: <what you did>`

### Commit Types:

- `feat`: New feature additions.
- `fix`: Bug fixes and corrections.
- `docs`: Documentation updates.
- `style`: Formatting or visual tweaks.
- `refactor`: Code restructuring, no functional changes.
- `perf`: Performance improvements.
- `test`: Test additions or updates.
- `build`: Dependency or build tool changes.
- `ci`: CI/CD modifications.
- `chore`: Routine maintenance tasks.
- `update`: Minor non-functional improvements.

## Commit Rules

- **Be clear and direct**: Write commits that precisely describe the changes.
- **Use present tense**: E.g., "add email validation" not "added email validation".
- **Avoid vague or temporary commits**: Keep unfinished work in local branches or draft PRs.

### Example Commit Messages

- `feat: implement authentication middleware`
- `fix: fix route resolution issue`
- `docs: update API documentation`
- `style: add typings for user contract interface`

### Why It Matters

A clear commit history streamlines code reviews, collaboration, and debugging, maintaining project organization and quality.
